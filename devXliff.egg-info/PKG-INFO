Description:     XLIFF is a xml based standard that is commonly used in Computer Assisted Translation tools for data exchange.
        
            #Basic XLIFF structure is as follows# 
            Root element is "xliff" which can have multiple "file" elements as 
            children nodes (although in this library single "file" element  is being used for simplicity)
            Each file have "header" and "body" elements as its children. 
            Each body can have multiple children elements by the name "trans-unit"
            Each "trans-unit" can have multiple children by the name "source" and "target" (former
            for source language and latter for target languege
            
            In this library, this XLIFF heirarchy has been used to create XLIFF files.
            You may refer to demo.py to look at basic consumption of this library.
